# OrgLimits
Inspired by jthurst01's OrgLimits package (https://github.com/jthurst01/OrgLimits) but completely rebuilt using SFDX and taking advantage of Salesforce's new System.OrgLimits class.

## Translations
I built as much of this as I could to be translatable, but I don't know any other languages. If you update the custom labels to for your locale, please consider adding them here.
